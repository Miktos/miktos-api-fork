# API Client Test Fixes

## Summary of Issues Fixed

We fixed issues with the OpenAI and Gemini client tests where actual API calls were being made instead of using mocked responses. These issues were preventing tests from running properly in isolation without real API keys.

## Changes Made

### OpenAI Client Improvements

1. Added a `get_current_client()` helper function to make client mocking easier
2. Moved client retrieval to the beginning of the `generate_completion` function
3. Ensured test patching targets both the `client` variable and `get_client()` function
4. Fixed test setup to properly mock the client

### Gemini Client Improvements

1. Added a `create_generative_model()` function to make model initialization testable
2. Fixed the `generate_content` call to ensure the mock is properly used
3. Updated test patching to mock `is_configured` and `configure_genai()`
4. Fixed the async handling of `generate_content` calls

### Testing Approach Improvements

1. Created comprehensive mocking strategies for both clients
2. Made sure function calling tests properly handle the mocked objects
3. Created documentation for proper testing patterns

## Files Changed

1. `/Users/atorrella/Desktop/Miktos_VS-Code/miktos_backend/integrations/openai_client.py`
2. `/Users/atorrella/Desktop/Miktos_VS-Code/miktos_backend/integrations/gemini_client.py`
3. `/Users/atorrella/Desktop/Miktos_VS-Code/miktos_backend/tests/unit/test_openai_fixed.py`
4. `/Users/atorrella/Desktop/Miktos_VS-Code/miktos_backend/tests/unit/test_gemini_function_calling_basic.py`

## Documentation Added

- Created a new [Testing API Clients](/Users/atorrella/Desktop/Miktos_VS-Code/miktos_backend/TESTING_API_CLIENTS.md) guide with detailed instructions and examples

## Testing Verification

All tests are now passing and confirm that the client code is properly mocked during testing, preventing actual API calls.
